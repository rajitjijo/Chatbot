# Cornell Movie Dialog Chatbot ðŸŽ¬ðŸ’¬

This is a simple chatbot I built using the **Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus**.  
The dataset is a collection of movie scripts with conversations between characters, and I used it to train a model that can respond to user input like a dialogue system.

---

## What it does
- Reads the Cornell Movie Dialog dataset  
- Cleans and organizes the conversations into input/response pairs  
- Trains a sequence-to-sequence model (encoderâ€“decoder with attention)  
- Lets you chat with the model in the terminal
